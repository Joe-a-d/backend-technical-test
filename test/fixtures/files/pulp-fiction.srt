1
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:34,200
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,744
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,747
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,291
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,795
You forget about it in a day or two.
The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,964
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,249
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,261
I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,847
Quack, quack, quack. Take heart, 'cause
you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,351
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're
never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,147
After tonight? Correct. I
got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,109
Can I get anyone more coffee?
Oh, yes!

13
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,488
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,658
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,536
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,663
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,749
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop
you in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:28,045
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,591
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,635
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,280
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,188
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:47,023
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone,
not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,736
Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,531
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,576
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,621
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,123
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,336
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,422
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,424
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,843
You tell 'em empty out the register, they
don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,803
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:22,141
We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna
make us kill him. I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,520
I don't want to either. But they'll probably
put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,522
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,233
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,738
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,740
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,700
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,703
We're out of it.
Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,872
Not in this life.
What then?

43
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,210
<i>Garcon, coffee!</i>

44
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,587
This place.

45
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,175
<i>Garcon</i> means boy.

46
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,056
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,101
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,854
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,233
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,028
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,782
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,494
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,124
I bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this. Correct.

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,460
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,879
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,804
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,845
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

58

Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1 .50 an hour...

59

really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,562
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:54,358
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the
next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:59,488
See, I got the idea the last liquor
store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,241
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,162
You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,582
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.

66
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,001
Yes, we did. A lot of
people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,713
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,840
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,344
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,974
Come on. All right. Same
as last time, remember?

71
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,810
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

Hash is legal there, right? Yeah,
it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

93

And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

thing about Europe is? What?

a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

106

They don't call it
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

107
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,330

know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.

108
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,251

- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
